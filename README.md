# Hacking with SwiftUI

## 100 Days of SwiftUI

#### Studying through Paul Hudson's "100 Days of SwiftUI". 
It is great to reflect and see how my code has changed through out the 100 days.

| Milestone 4-6 - Multiplication          | Built an app that helps chilren learn their multiplication tables. They choose which number they'd like to practice and how many reps they would like to do (It is can be embarrassing to look on past code and UI choices. I will leave it here for purposes of comparison - Although sometime in the future I'd like to have another go at this challenge). | <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/09_Milestone4-6/screenshots/screen01.png" width=30% height=30%> <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/09_Milestone4-6/screenshots/screen02.png" width=30% height=30%> <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/09_Milestone4-6/screenshots/screen03.png" width=30% height=30%> |

| Milestone 10-12 - FriendFace            | Social Media App. This milestone challenge mostly focuses on netowrking and data models. <br> _I decided to do some research on MVVM architecture and added it in this project._ </br>                                                                                     | <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/17_Milestone10-12/screenshots/screen01.png" width=30% height=30%> <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/17_Milestone10-12/screenshots/screen02.png" width=30% height=30%> |
| Milestone 10-12(Core Data) - FriendFace | Implement Core Data into the above project. Have had a lot of trouble with this one. decided to go through the rest of the course and come back to it in order to review in further depth.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | *NOT COMPLETE!*|
| Project 13 - Instafilter                | Made an app that's able to filter images using Core Image Filters. The main focus of the project was to intergrate UIKit Views/ Controllers into our SwiftUI project. On top of the challenges I made it so that the name of the filter will show in the bottom left corner on the screen and that when a photo is saved it will do a 3D Rotation Animation. <br> _UIKit integration, Core Image, Custom bindings, Action Sheets._                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |<img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/18_Project13/screenshots/screen01.png" width=30% height=30%> <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/18_Project13/screenshots/screen02.png" width=30% height=30%> <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/18_Project13/screenshots/screen03.png" width=30% height=30%>|
| Project 14 - Bucket List                | This lesson focused on Mapkit integrations and Biometric authen tication. This app allows us to pin a spot on a map and edit it's infomation. When editing a location the app also calls to Wikipedia's API to get some good suggestions from around the area you pinned. The challenges in this project were quite hard I found, especially making the EditView use MVVM. Another brilliant, fun lesson from Paul Hudson. <br> _MapKit, Biometric authentication, Secure data writing, Comparable custom types, Documents directory_  | <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/19_Project14/screenshots/screen01.png" width=30% height=30%> <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/19_Project14/screenshots/screen02.png" width=30% height=30%>|
| Project 15 - Accessibility              | This lesson did not have particular app that we needed to build. Instead we briefly learned about different ways of adding accessibility to our projects and then in the challenge we were asked to add what was learnt to prior projects. <br> _Accessibility_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/20_Project15/screenshots/screen01.JPG" width=30% height=30%> |
| Milestone 13-15 - Photo Collector        | The spaghetti came togehter and I managed to complete the 5th Milestone project for Hacking with swiftUI! In this milestone project we were asked to build and app that would let a user either take a picture or choose a picture from their photos and store it on their Home Page (I choose to show the photos in a LazyVGrid rather than a List). A second task was added on Day 78 by Paul Hudson and that was to also add MapKit to the equation. I added latitude and longitude to my Post struct and had a computed property to track my coordinates. In the app's AddView user's can choose use their current location with the photo or they are free to choose a custom location. In the detail view of each post the user can see their photo, name, description and location. This Milestone took me 3 days of hard work to complete - I am glad! It solidified my knowledge of _FileManager, MapKit, UIViewRepresentable and Core Location_.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/21_Milestone13-15/screenshots/screen01.png" width=30% height=30%> <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/21_Milestone13-15/screenshots/screen02.png" width=30% height=30%> <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/21_Milestone13-15/screenshots/screen03.png" width=30% height=30%> <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/21_Milestone13-15/screenshots/screen04.png" width=30% height=30%> <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/21_Milestone13-15/screenshots/screen05.png" width=30% height=30%> <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/21_Milestone13-15/screenshots/screen06.png" width=30% height=30%> |
| Project 16 - Hot Prospects              |  In this Project we were asked to build an app that tracks people we meet at conferences. with in the app you can check between contacted prospetcs and uncontacted prospects and also share and read QR Codes. It was great to come back to filter() in the challenges and also get another chance to change USerDefaults to document directory within FileManager.  <br> _Custom environment objects, Tab Views, Result, objectWillChange, Image interpolation, Context menus, Local notifications, Swift package dependencies, filter(), map()_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |<img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/22_Project16/screenshots/screen04.png" width=30% height=30%> <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/22_Project16/screenshots/screen02.png" width=30% height=30%> <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/22_Project16/screenshots/screen03.png" width=30% height=30%> <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/22_Project16/screenshots/screen01.png" width=30% height=30%> <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/22_Project16/screenshots/screen05.png" width=30% height=30%> <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/22_Project16/screenshots/screen06.png" width=30% height=30%>|
| Project 17 -  Flashzilla      | In this project we built a flash card app. You can make your own customs flashcards and practice them over and over. The main focus of the lesson was gestures. We learned how to make a tinder-like swipe system for correct and incorrect cards. After completing this project, I feel closures are the true heroes of Swift. Passing the var removal = ((Bool) -> Void)? = nil from the CardView to ContentView is so "swifty"! I learnt so much from this project. Also there were 5 challenges for this project all of which I managed to complete. The challenge to get incorrect cards back into the deck took me some stack overflow searches and creeping through other peoples code. But, as all programmers do that, I don't count it is as cheating.  <br> _Gestures, Haptics, Combine, Timers, Accessibility_                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |<img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/23_Project17/screenshots/screen04.png" width=50% height=50%> <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/23_Project17/screenshots/screen02.png" width=50% height=50%> <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/23_Project17/screenshots/screen03.png" width=50% height=50%> <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/23_Project17/screenshots/screen01.png" width=50% height=50%> <img src="https://github.com/thompson-dean/100-Days-of-SwiftUI/blob/main/23_Project17/screenshots/screen05.png" width=50% height=50%> |
| Project 18 -  Layout and Geometry                 | There was no particular app made for this project. We are asked to complete some challenges on a scrollview. We were asked to make the views opaque as they rise to the top of the scroll view, have the views become smaller as they rise and also have the colors changes as views are swiped up.
